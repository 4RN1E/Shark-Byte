# Shark-Byte
This is a marine conservation project initially aimed for shark conservation and awareness globally. The goal is to create a mobile app that can not only track sharks but also educate people on the different species and their details. Sharks are a valuable part of the marine ecosystem and their numbers have declined over the years.
