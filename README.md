# Shark-Byte
This is a marine conservation project initially aimed for shark conservation and awareness globally. The goal is to create a mobile app that can not only track sharks but also educate people on the different species and their details. Sharks are a valuable part of the marine ecosystem and their numbers have declined over the years.

This app is being created with the assistance of my Codepath mentors. 

They asked me to answer a few questions like what are my 3 favorite apps right now and what 2 features make them my favorite.

I enjoy Instagram, TikTok, and Ocearch Shark Tracker.

2 things I love about Instagram are the integration of META AI and The ability to scroll on reels.

2 things I love about TikTok are the amount of information that is on it and how easy it is to find a meme or video to help you pass calculus.

2 things I love about Ocearch is the tracker, it does not just track sharks it also tracks whales and turtles. I also like how you can learn more about the particular shark you are tracking like their name and species.

I want Shark Byte to be better than Ocearch because I have always had a fascination with sharks since I was a kid. Books regarding sharks were the only books I would love to read, that and books about dinosaurs. I want to integrate the Ai that I have been working on to this app. I also want to make it an app that creates a feeling similar to the books I read when I was younger. I want people of all ages to learn about sharks and other marine life. There is so much misconception and fear behind them and the truth is that people go to the beach and get within 5 feet of a shark and never know. Through this app I plan on starting a non-profit organization oriented on marine life conservation. I want to add trackers, modules where people can learn maybe similar to a book where they can scroll to learn about sharks. I want to add a part of the app where people can chat with the AI that I have been training to give information on any shark they want to learn about.
